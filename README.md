## Cloning the code for re-deployment

### If your service isn’t on GOV.UK
You are welcome to use the GOV.UK patterns and frontend code even if your service isn’t considered part of GOV.UK. Although you will sometimes need to use different patterns, for example if you are building something like an admin interface.

While you can use the patterns, your site or service must not:

- identify itself as being part of GOV.UK
- use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
- use the GDS Transport typeface
-vsuggest that it’s an official UK government website if it is not

These things are there to provide a consistent identity and navigation between GOV.UK and the sites and transactional services that hang off it. If your service isn’t on GOV.UK, there’s no need to maintain that identity - in fact, you might confuse or mislead people if you do.

You should also use the brand logo and font of your organisation.

Please consult the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk) for additional information.
